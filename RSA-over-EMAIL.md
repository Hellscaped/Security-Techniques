# RSA over EMAIL
## If your only means of communication with someone is email, and there are some prying eyes (school, work, etc etc) then this would be good for you.
### Tools:
[RSA Key Generator & Encrypt/Decrypt](https://www.javainuse.com/rsagenerator)
### THE HANDSHAKE
Sometimes, well, you have prying eyes, and you wanna talk with someone truly in private.
You can use this method until you get a better method of communication.
Keep in mind that you shouldn't use this method for encrypting large files, and using 4096 bit keys gives you the most security.

#### SENDING:
1. Go to the website
2. Point the receiver to this article (SPECIFICALLY THE RECEIVING SECTION)
3. Await their public key.
4. Put their public key in the RSA Encryption public key section
5. Put your message in the box above and click the green "Encrypt" button
6. Copy the encrypted message and send them it.
7. You're done!

#### RECEIVING:
1. Go to the website.
2. Click "Generate Keys"
3. Save the private key. NEVER SHARE THIS WITH ANYONE!
4. Save the public key. This is the one you wanna share with the sender. (For example, one of mine is ``MFwwDQYJKoZIhvcNAQEBBQADSwAwSAJBAK6E7Alg660A19MO4YzmtcUavfRkM+K0hUyY87CnCx2LbV/jKUzRowC4huRByerWsEL8bSCdgZokYBIBmOpUQP0CAwEAAQ==``)
5. Point the sender towards this article if they aren't already familiarized with it. (SPECIFICALLY THE SENDING SECTION)
6. Send the sender your public key
7. Await the encrypted message
8. Go to the RSA Decryption section and put your private key in the private key box
9. Put the encrypted message in the encrypted text box
10. Click decrypt
11. You're done! That message should be readable by only you at this point.
